# BOM-Edit-Tool-GUI
# 20/2/2019 update
The purpose is write a tool GUI user interface in Windows. Becase my job is hardware engineer, we often handle so much data about PCBA BOM.
It is complicated and boring, so I want to write a sofware tool to help my workmates do BOM edit job.
Haha, finally I became a hardworking man, I was learning to write while writing them.
